**PartOfDayTTS is an exercise program I am developing to improve my Python coding.** 

The program will use the integrated command datetime to grab the hour, minutes and seconds. 
It will then isolate the current hour, and do a number check to see what part of the day it is. 
I have implemented the pyttsx3 library to enable cross-platform TTS usage for the visually impaired. 

**Work In Progress:**
- Multi language TTS and text support

**To do:**
- Basic GUI
- Voice notification when a new hour comes
- Animal Crossing synched music? Just a fun idea!
