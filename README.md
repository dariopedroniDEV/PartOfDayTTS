**PartOfDayTTS is an exercise program I am developing to improve my Python coding.** 

The program will use the integrated command datetime to grab the hour, minutes and seconds. 
It will then isolate the current hour, and do a number check to see what part of the day it is. 
I have implemented the pyttsx3 library to enable cross-platform TTS usage for the visually impaired. 

The advantage of pyttsx3 is that it natively supports Windows, macOS and Linux. It also works completely offline.
Note: As of right now, the code and file structure is messy. It is not ready for use.

**Libraries in use - install these with PIP through Terminal**
- Testing out Pyglet for sound engine and Windows GUI
- pyttsdx3 (TTS)
- eyeD3 (Reading metadata from mp3)



**Work In Progress:**
- Multi language TTS and text support (For loop completed for language selection. Moving on to string localization) + Ty Mazter for your help!
- Animal Crossing dynamic hourly playback. (Time updating each minute) 

**To do:**
- 
- Event Scheduler, so that multiple processes can work at the same time.
- Integrate a weather research for rain/snow music variants
- Basic GUI for settings such as language and voice notification
- Voice notification when a new hour comes (Maybe even each half hour or quarter?)

- Hotkey menu while running from Python Console.
