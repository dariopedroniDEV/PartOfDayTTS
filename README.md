**PartOfDayTTS is an exercise program I am developing to improve my Python coding.** 

The program will use the integrated command datetime to grab the hour, minutes and seconds. 
It will then isolate the current hour, and do a number check to see what part of the day it is. 
I have implemented the pyttsx3 library to enable cross-platform TTS usage for the visually impaired. 

The advantage of pyttsx3 is that it natively supports Windows, macOS and Linux. It also works completely offline.


**Work In Progress:**
- Multi language TTS and text support (For loop completed for language selection. Moving on to string localization) + Ty Mazter for your help!


**To do:**
- Basic GUI for settings such as language and voice notification
- Voice notification when a new hour comes (Maybe even each half hour or quarter?)
- Animal Crossing music? Just a fun idea!
- Hotkey menu while running from Python Console.
